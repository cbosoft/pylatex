# PyLaTeX

Are you like me? Do you write lengthy python scripts to perform a calculation from logged data? Do you then have to copy the information over to a report? Isn't this just the most tiresome thing? PyLaTeX seeks to end this faff!

PyLaTeX is a collection of python classes which represent LaTeX documents (articles, reports). As you go along writing your (lenghty, complex) calculation script you can on the fly write the report (as you might comment your code). Then, when the script is done, the report is done too! You can have it automatically compile to pdf, or just output to .tex. Bibliographies are supported through `bibtex`, equations written in TeX math (`amsmath`, `amsfont`, and `amssymb` are included by default).
